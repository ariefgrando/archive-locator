Archiving system using Codeigniter

A simple web based system to store and find the location of your files in cabinets

The main idea is to help you find the location of a files within a series of cabinets and store a location of files in cabinets, this system of course ideally works if you have a neat physical file repository (you put a letter on a file holder and the file holder stored inside a cabinet)
